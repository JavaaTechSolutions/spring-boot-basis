# Integrate Log4j2 with Spring Boot 3
#### In this tutorial, weâ€™ll look into the Log4j2 extensions in a Spring Boot application.

- Add the Log4j2 dependency into our project's pom.xml file.
- To use the Log4j2 library rather than the default Logback, we need to exclude Logback from our starter dependencies:

  ``` Pom Dependency
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
        </exclusions>
    </dependency>

Also, we need to add spring-boot-starter-log4j2 and log4j-spring-boot dependencies to our pom.xml file:

            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-log4j2</artifactId>
            </dependency>

Next, create a log4j2.xml file in the src/main/resources folder of your project.

In the log4j2.xml file, you can configure your logging properties such as log levels, appenders, and log formats.

- Logging Levels: Log4j supports multiple logging levels, including DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL. Developers can choose the appropriate level based on the severity of the message they want to log.

- Configurability: Log4j allows developers to configure logging behavior through configuration files (such as XML or properties files) or programmatically. This configuration includes settings for logging levels, log file appenders, log formats, and more.

- Appenders: Log4j uses the concept of "appenders" to specify where log messages should be outputted. Common appenders include the console appender, file appender, rolling file appender, SMTP appender (for sending emails), and more. Developers can also create custom appenders as needed.

In Log4j 2, the <Appender> tag is used to define the destination or output location for log messages. Appenders specify where log events should be written, such as to the console, a file, a database, or a network socket. Each appender can have its own configuration settings, including the output format, file name, encoding, and other parameters specific to the appender type.

Here's what you need to include within the <Appender> tag:

Name (required): The name attribute uniquely identifies the appender within the configuration. You reference this name when associating the appender with loggers.
Appender Type (required): Log4j provides various types of appenders, such as ConsoleAppender, FileAppender, RollingFileAppender, SocketAppender, and more. Choose the appropriate appender type based on your logging requirements.

PatternLayout is a key component of the Log4j logging framework that allows developers to define the format of log messages.
